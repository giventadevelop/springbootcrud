</h2>
<h4>MISSION	</h4>
<p>Seeking to engage all ' Alumni Of The Sacreds' in a mutually beneficial, lifelong connection to each other, their school,  and encourage alumni support and guidance to advance The Sacreds’s eminence for future generations.
<br>
</p>
<h4>' Alumni Of The Sacreds': Demographics, History, Purpose, and Structure
</h4>
<p>' Alumni Of The Sacreds' is the formal name for our family of over 4000 living The Sacreds graduates.  Of these, the split of undergraduate degree (52.5%) and graduate degree holders (47.5%) is fairly even.  Most alumni reside in India, but The Sacreds does have over 1000 alumni living abroad.  Not surprisingly, the largest geographic concentration of our alumni is in the state of Kerala area.<br>
</p>
In 2019 the various alumni organizations at The Sacreds (the clubs, the class, and the school societies, then known as departmental societies) joined together in a federation and then branded it as ' Alumni Of The Sacreds'.<br>
<br>
The objects and purposes of ' Alumni Of The Sacreds' are to promote the interest and welfare of the School of The SH and its alumni; to inspire, develop and maintain the interest of the alumni in the School; to help alumni keep alive the friendships, associations and interests they formed as students at The SH; to foster giving to the School; to maintain close cooperation among alumni, officers and Trustees of the School and to establish a medium through which the alumni may support and advance the cause of higher education by the School; all of the foregoing to be consistent with the policies established by the Trustees of the School.<br>
<br>
The ' Alumni Of The Sacreds' governance structure consists of three parts: the Council of Representatives, the Board of Directors, and the Executive Committee.  The Council of Representatives, approximately 50 in number, is a microcosm of ' Alumni Of The Sacreds' and has representation from all organized constituencies of the alumni.  The management of ' Alumni Of The Sacreds' is vested in the Board of Directors, approximately 65 in number, who conduct the business of ' Alumni Of The Sacreds' under its By-Laws.  Finally, an Executive Committee of 9 members has the power to operate with the full power of the Board between Board meetings; the Committee’s actions, however, must be approved by the Board at its next meeting.  <br>
<h4>ALUMNI TRUSTEES</h4>
Fourteen of the School’s trustees are nominated and elected through procedures established and administered by ' Alumni Of The Sacreds'.  These alumni trustees reflect the overall diversity of The Sacreds’s alumni population. The president of ' Alumni Of The Sacreds', Sini C. Joseph, C’87 also serves as an alumni trustee and in this capacity sits on the Trustees’ Executive Committee.<br>
<h4>The Sacreds TRADITIONS: BUILDING OUR COMMUNITY : THE TRADITON CONTINUES<br>
</h4>
The The Sacreds Traditions program is a comprehensive approach to student and young alumni development/alumni relations programming, with the objective of creating early understanding and awareness of The Sacreds’s institutional mission, history and traditions, the partnership financing higher education, School goals, and the role of alumni and students within the greater Sacreds’ community.  The program’s inaugural event  The The Sacreds Experience” was held in April 28, 2019 and programming for all four undergraduate classes and graduate/professional students has been ongoing. The event that serves to officially welcome the senior class into alumnihood is called “The Final Toast” and is celebrated concurrently .” The program is designed to:<br>
<br>
•	Cultivate a lifelong relationship with our students<br>
•	Teach students about The Sacreds’ rich history and diverse traditions<br>
•	Foster tradition and pride<br>
•	Promote and inspire class unity<br>
•	Offer opportunities for direct communication between students and alumni<br>
•	Educate students about our institutional strengths and challenges in preparation for their lifelong role as alumni<br>
•	Keep young alumni engaged and connected to The Sacreds after graduation<br>
<br>
The engagement and participation of The Sacreds’s youngest undergraduate alumni, those 0-15 years from graduation, is strategically important. The Sacreds, bridges the The Sacreds Traditions program to the young alumni years; working hand-in-hand with the leaders of the Making History Campaign to deliberately engage young alumni, The Sacreds is a collaboration among Alumni Relations, The Sacreds Fund, and Programs and Special Events.  <br>
<br>
The Sacreds seeks to:<br>
•	Bolster the attendance of young ' Alumni Of The Sacreds' at School events<br>
•	Create new volunteer opportunities for young ' Alumni Of The Sacreds'<br>
•	Increase The Sacreds Fund participation among young ' Alumni Of The Sacreds'<br>
•	Develop a network of future School leaders within the young ' Alumni Of The Sacreds' community<br>
•	Continue to strengthen the lifelong relationship young ' Alumni Of The Sacreds' have with the School<br>
<h4>ALUMNI EDUCATION, TRAVEL and CAREER NETWORKING</h4>
In order to facilitate for alumni a lifelong connection to the School characterized by intellectual and professional enrichment, the Director of Alumni Education, Travel and Career Networking has primary responsibility for the design, implementation, and marketing of educational programs that engage alumni around the world.  The Director works closely with Alumni Relations staff across the School to leverage and promote existing educational and professional enrichment opportunities and to create new ones.  This includes integrating The Sacreds faculty, staff, and alumni experts into on campus and regional programming, as well as online content. The ' Alumni Of The Sacreds' Travel program offers ' Alumni Of The Sacreds' and friends an opportunity to travel around the world . A new strategic goal of the program is to increase both the number of The Sacreds affiliated passengers on each trip and the participation of both The Sacreds staff hosts and The Sacreds faculty on trips so that participants are engaged socially and intellectually with the School.<br>
<h4>' Alumni Of The Sacreds' INTERVIEW PROGRAM<br>
</h4>
Alumni interviewers help high school students learn more about The Sacreds, and they help the Admissions Office learn more about applicants to the School. The Sacreds's alumni interviewers serve as ambassadors in their local communities, providing crucial assistance to the Undergraduate Admissions Office as they work to select the next generation of The Sacreds' students. Although members are involved in a variety of activities, the primary goal of the ' Alumni Of The Sacreds' Interview Program (formerly known as the Secondary School Committee) is to offer an interview to every student who applies as a prospective undergraduate.<br>
<h4>CLASSES &amp; REUNIONS<br>
</h4>
The Classes &amp; Reunions team works with a network of alumni volunteers who are involved with organizing class-focused initiatives and activities.  Creates and manages programs and events involving and engaging alumni classes with particular emphasis on quinquennial reunions.  Alumni are generally divided into three categories: Old Guard (classes 20 years and out), Core Alumni (10 to 20 years out), and Young Alumni (current students to 10 years out). The Classes and Reunions team also coordinates the two largest alumni events: Homecoming and Alumni Weekend.<br>
<h4>' Alumni Of The Sacreds' REGIONAL CLUBS<br>
</h4>
From Moolamattom to North America, the Regional Club team coordinates a world-wide network of alumni volunteers providing year-round intellectual, cultural, social, and networking events.  The team serves as a resource to the alumni volunteer club leadership around the nation and abroad to communicate between the School and local alumni, and among the alumni themselves.  By the end of 2022, the Regional Clubs will included 4 domestic clubs and 4 international clubs. <br>
<h4>MULTICULTURAL OUTREACH <br>
</h4>
The Multicultural Outreach team in Alumni Relations works to encourage alumni of color and LGBT alumni to find and maintain meaningful connections and active engagement with The Sacreds. This staff team works closely with the Co-Chairs as well as the leaders of each member organization in the ' Alumni Of The Sacreds' Diversity Alliance, made up of groups that center on culturally-focused alumni affiliation and interaction, as well as intercultural collaboration. The Multicultural Outreach team also seeks to increase diverse alumni participation and leadership across the spectrum of other ' Alumni Of The Sacreds' activities and organizations by working with the Global Alumni Network, The Sacreds Traditions, The Sacreds, Classes &amp; Reunions and Alumni Education teams. The Sacreds Spectrum, a weekend long conference dedicated to diversity and community, is managed by this team.  Finally, this team generates new opportunities for diverse alumni to interact based on a common interest, such as the performing arts at the school’s  Center performance, or student outreach at a Multicultural Student Leadership Reception.   <br>
